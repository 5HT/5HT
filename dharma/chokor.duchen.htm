<div align=right><h2>Dharma Cakra<br>Pravartana Sutra</h2></div>

<p style="color:black;">
This is what I heard. The Teacher was staying at Baranasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana.
Then he addressed the group of five bhikkhus.
</p>

<p>"There are, bhikkhus, two dead-ends which should not be pursued by
one-who-has gone forth. Which two? Addiction to pleasure through
indulging in sensuality, which is low, village-like, pertaining
to the unawake person, undignified and unfulfilling; and addiction
to self-punishment, which is painful, undignified and unfulfilling."</p>

<p>"The middle way, bhikkhus, awakened to by the tathāgata, does not
lead to these two dead-ends, but makes for vision and knowledge, is
conducive to calming, lucid understanding, awakening, and nibbāna."</p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, is this middle way...? It is just this noble
eightfold path, that is: right vision, right thought, right speech,
right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,
right concentration..."</p>

<p>"This is dukkha: birth is dukkha, ageing is dukkha, sickness is dukkha, death is dukkha, encountering what is not dear is dukkha, separation from what is dear is dukkha, not getting what one wants is dukkha. This psycho-physical condition is dukkha."</p>
<p>"This is the arising: it is craving, which is repetitive, wallowing in attachment and greed, obsessively indulging in this and that: craving for stimulation, craving for existence, craving for non-existence."</p>
<p>"This is the ceasing: the traceless fading away and cessation of that craving, the letting go and abandoning of it, freedom and independence from it."</p>
<p>"And this is the path: the path with eight branches: right vision, thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration."</p>

<p>"'Such is dukkha. It can be fully known. It has been fully known.'"</p>
<p>"'Such is the arising. It can be let go of. It has been let go of.'"</p>
<p>"'Such is the ceasing. It can be experienced. It has been experienced.'"</p>
<p>"'Such is the path. It can be cultivated. It has been cultivated.'"</p>

<p>"There arose in me illumination about things previously unknown."</p>

<p>"As long as my knowledge and vision was not entirely clear about the
   twelve aspects of the four, I did not claim to have had a peerless
   awakening in this world with its humans and celestials, its gods
   and devils, its ascetics and priests. Only when my knowledge and
   vision was clear in all these ways, did I claim to have had such awakening."</p>

<p>"‘The freedom of my mind is unshakable. There will be no more repetitive existence.’"</p>

<p style="color:black;">This is what he said. Inspired, the five delighted in his words.
   While he was speaking, the dispassionate, stainless dhamma eye arose
   in Kondanna: "Whatever arises ceases." [Mv. I, 6.16-28, pp. 15-7.
                                           Cf. S. 56:11, pp. 1843-6, tr. SB]</p>

<p>"If, Mahali, form, feelings, perceptions, inclinations and consciousness
   were exclusively suffering (dukkha), immersed in suffering, steeped in
   suffering, and if they were not also steeped in pleasure (sukham),
   beings would not become enamoured of them. But because the aggregates
   are pleasurable, beings become enamoured of them. By being enamoured
   of them, they are captivated by them, and by being captivated by them
   they are corrupted (san kilissanti)" [S. 22:60].</p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, are dhammas that should be fully understood?
   Form, bhikkhus, is a dhamma that should be fully understood;
   feeling... perception... inclination... consciousness are dhammas
   that should be fully understood."</p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, is full understanding? The ending of greed,
   the ending of hatred, the ending of confusion. That is called
   full understanding." [S. 22: 23, p. 872. Cf. the unconditioned.]<p>

<p>[Punna Mantaniputta:] "It is by clinging, Ananda, that ‘I am’
   occurs, not without clinging. It is by clinging to form, feelings,
   perceptions, inclinations and consciousness that ‘I am’ occurs,
   not without clinging."</p>

<p>"Suppose, friend Ananda, a young woman – or a man – youthful
   and fond of ornaments, would examine her own facial image in
   a mirror or in a bowl filled with pure, clean water: she would
   look at it with clinging, not without clinging. So too, it is
   by clinging to form that ‘I am’ occurs, not without
   clinging...." [S. III 22: 83, p. 928]</p>

<p>"Whoever in the past, the present or the future becomes
   fully awakened to things does so by becoming fully
   awakened to the four..." [S. 56:5, p. 1840.].</p>

<p>"This is suffering, this is the arising, this is the
   ceasing, this is the path: [in each] there are innumerable nuances,
   innumerable details, innumerable implications" [S. 56:19, p. 1851.]</p>

<p>"I do not say that the breakthrough to the four is accompanied
   by suffering or displeasure. It is accompanied only by happiness
   and joy." [S. 56:35, p. 1860.]</p>

<p style="color:black;">The Buddha compares a person who has not grasped the import of
   the four to “a tuft of cotton wool or kapok," which is blown
   hither and thither by the wind. Lacking direction and purpose,
   such a fickle person is prone “to look up at the face of another
   ascetic or brahmin, thinking: ‘This worthy one is surely one who
   knows, who really sees!’” Yet one who has understood the four is
   compared to “a stone column sixteen feet high, half of which is
   sunk in the ground and half of which stands above it.” For no
   matter how hard the winds blow, such a person does not “shake,
   quake or tremble” and has no inclination to go seeking wisdom
   at the feet of every passing guru. [S. 56:39-40, 1862-4.]</p>
